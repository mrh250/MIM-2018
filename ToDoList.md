This is a document to keep track of the things I'd like to implement in the MIM 2018 companion app.

## Definite To-do
- [ ] Populate the current template with relevant data
- [ ] Create _Options_ button that includes:
  - Show Tutorial
  - Other things?
- [ ] Create static splash screen
- [ ] Social information, such as:
  - Local restaurants
  - Nightlife

## Wanna To-Do
- [ ] User login for attendee list
- [ ] Make static splash screen dynamic using solid color splash screen and SVG _fake_ splash screen
- [ ] Add in _Interact_ page with a Facebook-like interface tied to Firebase
