This is a document to keep track of the things I'd like to implement in the MIM 2018 companion app.

## Definite To-do

- [ ] Create _Options_ button that includes:
  - Show Tutorial
  - Other things?
- [ ] Create Splash screen
- [ ] Social information, such as:
  - Local restaurants
  - Nightlife

## Wanna To-Do

- [ ] _Interact_ screen with a Facebook-like interface tied to Firebase
